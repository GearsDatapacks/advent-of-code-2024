# Gears' 2024 Advent of Code Solutions
## Written in Gleam!

Code for solving each day can be found in `src/aoc_2024/day_*.gleam`. The `pt_1` and `pt_2` functions run each part of the problem respectively.

**This Repository uses [gladvent](https://hexdocs.pm/gladvent)**. To run a day, run `gleam run run <day number>`, or `gleam run run all` to run all days at once.
**Warning**: This repo is set up with my puzzle inputs, which are not included in this repository. To run a day with your own puzzle inputs, you will need to change the `[gladvent.<year>.<day>]` expected values in `gleam.toml` (or remove them), and add your own inputs in `input/<year>/<day>.txt`.
